# Advent of code 2019

I will post my solutions to the 2019 Advent of code here. I will try to make all solutions generally applicable, to be functional with valid puzzle inputs. 

I only completed up to day 13 as of the end of the event, however will revisit problems as I gain confidence in my ability to solve them.

To see the problem descriptions, you can visit the website https://adventofcode.com/2019



# TODO
- Finish all problems
