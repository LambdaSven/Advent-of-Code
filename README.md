# Advent of code 2019

I will post my solutions to the 2019 Advent of code here, as well as post explaination for specific choices made
I will try to make all solutions generally applicable, to be functional with arbitrary inputs, [mostly] regardless of length. As long as the input follows the rules of the problem given, these solutions should work.

# TODO

- Fully comment all code
