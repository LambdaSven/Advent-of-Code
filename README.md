# Advent of code 2019

I will post my solutions to the Advent of code problems here, an include descriptions in the readme of why I took a particular approach

# Day 1
__Part 1__
Simple enough, I pass the input through the command line and do the arithmetic required.

__Part 2__
I felt like a recursive approach made sense here, so that's the approach I took. Again, a simple problem, but it is still only day 1 after all.
